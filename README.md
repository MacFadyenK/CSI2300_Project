## Project Summary
The Insert Project Name Here is designed to replicate the feel of common shopping websites and apps. 
It will allow the user to go through the motions of shopping for items and even replicate the act of buying the items online from within a shopping cart.  

This project was inspired from a personal contact who has trouble with a shopping addiction. It is not only this one person who has this problem. People all around the world struggle with shopping addictions, and though it may not seem detrimental at first, this addiction can end up costing people thousands of dollars and can disrupt and reduce quality of life.  

This app is designed to be used by those with a shopping addiction, in order to reduce the amount these users will spend on real shopping websites.
By using this app, users will get the same feelings as they do when using other popular shooping websites. They can go through the motions of looking for a product, adding it to the cart, and even paying for the product, all without actually spending any money.

The Project Name will benefit those all around the world by creating a safe app those with shopping addictions can go to without the risk of overspending.
