## Project Summary
Shopaholic is designed to replicate the feel of common shopping websites and apps. 
It will allow the user to go through the motions of shopping for items and even replicate the act of buying the items online from within a shopping cart.  

This project was inspired by a personal contact who has trouble with a shopping addiction, but it is not only them who has this problem. People all around the world struggle with shopping addictions, and though it may not seem detrimental at first, this addiction can end up costing people thousands of dollars and can disrupt their lives.  

This app is designed to be used by those with a shopping addiction, in order to reduce the amount of time these users will spend on real shopping websites.
By using this app, users will get the same feelings as they do when using other popular shopping websites. They can go through the motions of looking for a product, adding it to the cart, and even "buying" the product, all without actually spending any money.

Shopaholic will benefit those all around the world by creating a safe app that those with shopping addictions can go to without the risk of overspending.

Please replace 'your_javafx_file_path' with the hard file path to JavaFX.

The Shopaholic app is meant to resemble a classic shopping website. You can add items to your cart from the main screen, or alternatively click on the items for more details and add them to the cart from there. You can filter the items through selecting an option on the search bar dropdown. You can enter your cart by clicking on the cart button in the top right corner. Buying all items in the cart window will clear your cart. You can remove items from your cart at any location by clicking the remove button.
