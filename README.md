## Project Summary
Shopaholic is designed to replicate the feel of common shopping websites and apps. 
It will allow the user to go through the motions of shopping for items and even replicate the act of buying the items online from within a shopping cart.  

This project was inspired by a personal contact who has trouble with a shopping addiction, but it is not only them who has this problem. People all around the world struggle with shopping addictions, and though it may not seem detrimental at first, this addiction can end up costing people thousands of dollars and can disrupt their lives.  

This app is designed to be used by those with a shopping addiction, in order to reduce the amount of time these users will spend on real shopping websites.
By using this app, users will get the same feelings as they do when using other popular shopping websites. They can go through the motions of looking for a product, adding it to the cart, and even "buying" the product, all without actually spending any money.

Shopaholic will benefit those all around the world by creating a safe app that those with shopping addictions can go to without the risk of overspending.

This chosen information is saved once the “Add to Cart” button is clicked on the item details page.
Remember that this item information is still saved even if you remove the item from your cart, so if different item details are desired, you must re-enter the item details in the Item Details page.
